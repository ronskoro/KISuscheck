The table makes the range of fluctuation between the different products clear. Clearly also that favorable values in one indicator do not necessarily mean good values in the other indicators gates imply. Also the Degree the processing correlated not in everyone cases with unfavorable values.

However acts it itself at margarine around no natural product (Nutritional advice Rhineland-Palatinate, 2021) and also the kind of their Packaging can as problem matic estimated become.

One approach to comparative ecological evaluation is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, Lebenszyk- lus analysis) or the product life cycle assessment (WBAE, 2020). In contrast to CO 2 and water footprint becomes at the LCA not

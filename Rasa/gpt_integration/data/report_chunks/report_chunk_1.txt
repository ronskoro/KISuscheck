 model that considers the various aspects of sustainability. These are now more than the three classic pillars of ecology, economy and social affairs. Meanwhile, in science Aspects such as health in the sense of a nutritional system (see WBAE 2020) are just as important How corporate management or the aspect animal welfare.

Not only the resource efficiency , which is mostly in the form of an ecological balance (life cycle assessment â€“ LCA or life cycle analysis) represents becomes, considered become, rather also the further Consistent- strategies such as sufficiency and consistency are taken into account. Sufficiency means the conscious limitation from finite raw materials and Materials, after to the motto "Fewer is more". As third strategy approach, consistency describes action in cycles, i.e. the use of old native technologies to create a cycle from production to use to recycling ability from product substances to guarantee. Only all three strategies together care for for one wholeness ing sustainability , both in the Pursue How also at the Product.

Various sustainability models are briefly presented below, all of which are based on the agricultural and relate to the food sector.













Included is the Distinction to meet, consider I a whole Pursue or a single Product. At the Consideration one individual product is to take into account, that here the Danger one misinter pretation can take place, since an individual product received a positive sustainability rating can, what not means, that the entire Pursue as whole consistent operates.

And as a second point of view, it should be taken into account that, especially when evaluating the product, very trade-offs often occur, i.e. a property of a product improves, but in time one other Characteristic worse. This he follows in particular, if only separate aspects straight in the dimension environment/ecology are considered and communicated. Here is just a note against ben, that a lower CO 2 value, the above the reference size unit of measure generated becomes, simultaneously one higher toxicity and eutrophication having as the comparison product.

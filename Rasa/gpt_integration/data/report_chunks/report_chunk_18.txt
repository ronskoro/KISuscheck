Both products get deductions in environmental policy (-5 points) and in the type of packaging (- 15 points). The product on the right gets 15 points for production according to the EU organic regulation. This Points are offset against the life cycle assessment. Since the production method for the product on the left (out of unknown Found) not taken into account became, cuts be Eco score worse away – at otherwise same score. With it is missing for a and same product one clear assessment statement.

Around the weaknesses of Eco score to clarify become in the following two different Products considered with the same result for the Eco-Score. Again, no full calculation could be made of Eco scores take place. Therewith receive both Products a bad Eco score. In both cases became







the production method not taken into account, What but out of view one holistic point of view emergency would be necessary, since aspects such as biodiversity or animal welfare were not taken into account. Also show Dien von Antony (2021) that in extensive dairy cow farming this is possible with a complete LCA nope good cut off How in an intensive mode of production.

In order to make a correct statement as to how the Eco-Score differentiates between different production methods, EU organic, association organic or additional aspects such as fair and regional or not, For example, would it make sense to compare the following dairy products that cover these different aspects content: Upländer farm dairy, Arla organic pasture milk and Hamfelder Hof fresh milk. All three Dairy products became biological produced.

uplander Milk: certified fair milk after Bioland standard

Arla: organic pasture milk after EU organic regulation

Hamfelder court organic fresh milk – after Bioland standard

Production or animal welfare/animal husbandry: Arla advertises grazing. Should the milk actually come from nemark, grazing for the animals would be (more or less) obligatory - also because of of the organic logo.

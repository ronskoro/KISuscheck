, product-related environmental labels must be correct, verifiable and relevant be must and they may not mislead (WBAE, 2020).



It should taken into account become, if and which trade offs exist. This meets e.g. to, if only separate criteria are considered, e.g. a lower CO 2 footprint implies an intensification of pro- production, How approximately at Milk, tied together with lesser environmental pollution. A concrete Example might clearly, that a more differentiated View on the connections necessary is: One 10,000 l Cow has a CO 2 footprint of 1.0 kg CO 2 eq./kg milk, with 2.7 lactations, vs. a 6,000 l organic cow, with approx. 1.0 to 1.2 kg CO 2 eq./kg milk and 4.7 lactations (cf. FiBL, 2017). The increase in the annual yield of a cow reduces the "required number of animals on the farm" and thus the accumulation of greenhouse gases (TGH) such as than and nitrous oxide (Brade, 2014). At the same time it turns out that the higher the milk yield, the lower one possible saving effect of TGH potential (Antony, 2021). Simultaneously goes one increase the ecological cal milk production is accompanied by disadvantages in terms of energy expenditure and land use (Antony, 2021). Animal welfare and biodiversity aspects would also have to be taken into account at this point. terms 1 . As well the Theme generation and marketing from the Beef.



3.1.1  individual indicators

carbon footprint _


The carbon footprint _ (engl. carbon footprint) becomes also as carbon footprint _ or greenhouse gas balance designated not. He gives at, How many carbon dioxide emissions direct and indirect through one activity caused become or arise over the life stages of a product. Besides carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flow often other greenhouse gases such as methane or

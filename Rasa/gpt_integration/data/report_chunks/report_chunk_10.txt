 be crucial to solving this problem contribute, e.g. through the cultivation of renewable raw materials and the creation of biological ones CO 2 sinks in moors and forests.

However favor the country- and forestry land uses also the persistent biodivers sity (WBAE, 2020). With regard to the entire life cycle, the further production, Transport and trade levels, individually and together, average less than half of the burden on agriculture. However, there are exceptions, such as when transporting groceries by plane or in the case of very energy-intensive packaging. On the consumption side, too, there are look, it to take into account is applicable, see below (ibid.).

“Particularly problematic indirect land use effects result from the use of primary forests (primeval forests) or previous Protected areas such as moors. One Sustainable development of the food system therefore requires a combination of supply-side measures (both agricultural and economic de-intensification as well as ecological intensification) on the one hand and on the consumption side Measures on the other hand, especially reducing the consumption of animal products and food food losses” (WBAE, 2020).

In addition to intensively managed farms with a very high use of operating resources and narrow fruit extensively farmed conventional farms with varied crop rotation or more extensively follow Grassland use by suckler cows or extensive breeds. These different levels of intensity are also practiced in organic farming. In addition, in organic farming, the sluggish are (significantly) lower. Which in turn leads to a higher land consumption and larger environmental impact leads. Becomes e.g. at the production from milk more milk performance feed (esp out of soy) is used, the environmental impact also worsens (Antony, 2021). Since the topics use and -consumption always stronger at Meaning win, becomes itself future also the organic farming with the subjects "vertical farming" and aquaponics deal with must. Both can a Contribution to the urban Agriculture afford and to one reduction of land use contribute

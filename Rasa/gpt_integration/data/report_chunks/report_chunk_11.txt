Intensification and specialization in agriculture, the (intensive) use of fertilizers and plant protection agents and an increase in field sizes with a simultaneous decrease in field edge streaks fen are essential Causes, the to one Loss at biodiversity to lead. But also the "landscape structure has a significant impact on biodiversity, particularly in fauna” (WBAE, 2020). However, various studies come to the conclusion that organically farmed land in many cases have a higher biodiversity. The WBAE report therefore recommends that land use systems teme to be evaluated in a region-specific and company-type-specific manner, since this has a considerable influence on the characteristics of the results (WBAE, 2020). A positive contribution to the preservation of the cultural landscape and biodiversity, for example, the care and valorization of regional products (e.g. orchards) afford. Also the credit this surfaces on the eco account from Pursue in the Frame from Substitute-or compensation payments were conceivable.

State funds are currently being used to limit soybean cultivation in Germany (about 1% of the import quantities) to advance. The result of this is that soybean cultivation, which is comparatively low-yield here (approx. 3.5 t/ha) a high-yield Wheat- (8th t/ha) or grain maize cultivation (10 t/ha) repressed and so a indirect land-use change elsewhere on the World promoted (WBAE, 2020).











At this point, the topics of “ green genetic engineering ” and the use of genetically modified tered organisms (GMO) should be mentioned. This, as well as green genetic engineering in general, will be seen from afar rejected by parts of the German population. It is feared that the use of GMOs will have high environmental and has health consequences. GMO-free products are considered more sustainable. However, the WBAE is of the opinion that this "is not justified according to the current state of scientific knowledge" (cf

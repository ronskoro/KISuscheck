 nitrogen monoxide also contribute to the CO 2 footprint by CO 2 equivalents (short CO 2 eq.) be converted (nu3, 2021).

A study by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (Ifeu) makes it clear that it is not just â€œthe There is a "footprint" of a food, as this depends on numerous boundary conditions. The published Data to the carbon footprints _ from groceries soft partially clearly from each other the away. This deviations result itself often out of the respective question. So might it for example makes a big difference whether only domestic production is considered or whether imports are included and thus the annual average for food sold in Germany is included in the calculation. The situation is different again when it comes to a specific product such as regional and seasonal strawberries goes. In addition, CO 2 emissions from land use and land use change in many Studies not included (Ifeu, 2020). Not only the production is decisive for the ecological physical footprint, but also the type of transport, packaging and preservation of the food. Out of environmental view should for example on flown in Products waived become (ibid.). Simultaneously puts the WBAE report represent, that "one regional generation out of one sustainability perspective is not always the first choice, and reusable packaging is not (always) environmentally cher as disposable packaging are" (WBAE, 2020).

That also the food choices a Influence has, shows itself at the accounting from ready to eat dishes. Small recipe changes, such as substituting plant-based products for animal products, can decisive for be the overall balance and therewith offer savings potential.

Selected factors the one Influence on the carbon footprints _ from groceries have:

cultivation methods or. management forms

formulations (e.g fat content)

The comparison of the two forms of production (organic and conventional) showed that with increasing milk yield, the emissions out of digestion and fertilizer storage lose weight, for this the greenhouse gas emissions at the generation energetic greedy

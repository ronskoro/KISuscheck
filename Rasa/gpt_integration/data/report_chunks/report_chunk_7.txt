A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is possible through a balanced humus and nutrient balance in forage production, improved longevity and milk yield of the cows as well as an efficient heifer rearing possible at one simultaneously further waiver on import feed (Soy) possible (brade, 2014).

In addition to the greenhouse gases, other ecological footprints also play a role. Therefore, in the study of the Ifeu additionally water, surface and phosphate footprints as well as the energy requirements for approx. 30 Le- food calculated.

viewing worse. However, the aspect of animal welfare is forgotten in this approach as well as a feeding without imported goods. However, this is an important one, for example from the point of view of the consumer Sales argument, because a "turbo mast" is not desired, also with regard to sustainability. It is also forgotten here that in certain geographic regions with a high proportion of permanent grassland only a ruminant husbandry as a source of food with meat and dairy products is possible. Another point that is not taken into account by a carbon footprint is the quality of the meat . cal, such as flavor, veining, or marbling of the

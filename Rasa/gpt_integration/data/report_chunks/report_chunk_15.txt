ution Rules” and

"Cut-off criteria" (for ancillary processes or by-products) must be specified (cf. WBAE, 2020).

In phase 3, the effects are summarized in environmental categories (life cycle assessment) and units of action converted. These categories include, for example, climate change, water or land use tongue. Also Effects on the human permit itself model.

In phase 4, a sensitivity analysis is performed, conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made derived (interpretation phase).

According to WBAE puts "the Agriculture however one special Challenge represent, there the definition of the system boundaries and the acquisition of data due to the differences between the companies and the terogenicity the primary production difficult are" (WBAE, 2020). The is called, the Agriculture or. the Country- use is through one height variability shaped. Besides that gives it for different production process Data gaps that can only be filled with estimates. This makes the challenge gene and complexity one LCA clearly.

product Environment footprints (PEF)


A more comparable Approach for the LCA is the PEF method (product Environment footprint). The PEF is a multi-criteria method for life-cycle-based modeling and assessment of environmental effects, the through occurring Material- and energy flows (inputs) as well as the associated emissions





and waste streams (outputs) in the manufacture of products and the provision of services, arise hen” (Finkbeiner, 2018). [Note: Products are not just about food]. The difference to the LCA is the target group of the approach: The PEF is not only used for internal project and process optimization, but is also “oriented towards communication, business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) (ibid.). Full development and Assessment of PEFs as political or independent instruments in the transition phase. From this Ground becomes not closer responded to.

le to cradle (C2C)” strives thereafter, a positive footprint to leave behind. This principle follows to the Approach one continuous and consistent circular economy (in the contrast to "cradle to grave"). This means that the cradle to cradle approach evaluates the entire life cycle of a product ducts. This cycle "From the cradle to the cradle" describes "the secure and potentially infinite zir cultion of materials and nutrients in cycles. All ingredients are harmless and executable. Garbage in today's sense, as created by the "take-make-waste" model, does not exist more, but only usable nutrients” (EPEA, 2021). Cradle to cradle " promotes diversity and supports regional approaches . In the meantime gives it also a C2C product standard the also social standards taken into account" (ibid.).

Eco score


The calculation of eco score, one more comprehensive assessment tool, based on the life cycle analysis sen (LCA) for 2,500 product categories by the French state agency for ecological transition (Ademe) together with the French Research Institute of Agriculture, Food and Environment (Inrae) in the Agribalyse database. However, only standard ted CO 2 production data (plus bonuses or. less penalties) used. At the Eco score acts it This is a so-called Front of Pack (FOP) label , an identification on the front of packaged food.

The Eco-Score evaluates the environmental properties of a food, ie it records which environmental world footprint a product has. So gives it 16 categories, the at the Evaluation of product one role play:

For the People poisonous: non-carcinogenic

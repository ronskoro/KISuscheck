 meat due to a particular beef breed race or one longer grazing time on a species-rich Pasture.

water footprint


Another individual indicator is the water footprint. The water footprint is a Indicator for the use of water as a resource. The water footprint takes into account the so-called virtual water - and illustrates the human influence on water as a resource. Any product claims virtual water. That means it has a water footprint. And this one is mostly far greater than the visible amount of water consumed. According to the Federal Environment Agency, “more than half of the water for the required products and goods not from Germany” (UBA, 2021). Meat, Coffee and tea to count to the so-called thirsty goods – so products, the particularly What- serene intensive in of their manufacturing as well as her import are (p. Cape. 3.1.1.6). regional and seasonal Products reduce the consumption of virtual water, among other things, by avoiding imports (Swiss, 2020). concrete examples are in the study of Ifeu (Ifeu, 2020) as well as above the Water footprint network 2 to find.

The water footprint makes it possible to compare the water consumption of different products (cf. 

and offers the possibility of examining the influence of individual consumption on the global Present and compare water resources. For the calculation of the water footprint is done loud Ifeu one "Weighting the different consumed amounts of water after the Water scarcity, prevailing in each country where the consumption takes place” (Ifeu, 2020). The basis is the A WARE method after Boulay, 2018 3 (ibid.).

phosphate footprint


Rock phosphate is mined outside of Germany. Contributes to the phosphate footprint of food primarily the phosphate at, the as fertilizer for the agricultural production needed becomes. Added to this are phosphates, which are processed foods (e.g. fast food, ready meals, lemonades) added become. The Recording from phosphates above the food
